This is a work in progress.  Well, that's actually generous.  This needs work, and it gets it as someone has enough enough time and motivation to improve it.  

There are two versions.  
One works against an IMAP server that supports push IMAP notifcation so that we aren't polling the server continuously. 
The other works against a GMAIL account, supporting the unique GMAIL API and OAuth

The DMS system runs on a Raspberry PI ZeroW.  It doesn't need much compute.  It's operating as the default console application and relies on auto-login.  

The bash script needs to be modified to call MFA_Mail_Start.sh y appending  
...
sleep 30
./MFA_Mail_Start.sh $
...
to .bashrc and setting MFA_Mail_Start.sh as executable (mod 755) The 30 second delay is to ensure that the network is up and stable before attepting to start the application.

MFA_Mail_Start.sh 

* insures that the application is running and restarts it if not.
* Logs each start
* sets up the virtual environment required by Rasperry PI OS for libraries not maintained by Debian

The inataller must establish a virtual enviroment for the application and install the following libraries
* imaplib2 (if using an IMAP host server)
* pytz
